            The Star Wars fan club has a long and storied history, reaching all the way back to LAST WEEK! Yes, that is a longtime
            indeed. How did we start you might ask? Well, Blake thought it was a smart idea to take the most hyped sci-fi saga
            in history and make a website about it... how original.

            In all seriousness though, our group was founded by a man named Dwight Schrute in 2004 after his co-worker, Jim, 
            sent a fax to his copy machine saying that George Lucas needed him to work on community outreach. Of course, our Mr. Schrute,
            being a man of PEAK human intelligence, accepted the offer gracious. Welp, Mr. Schrute found out a year later that Jim was
            lying and decided to pass the torch down to me. So here I am, developing a community hub for Star Wars lovers, all of which 
            is powered by ASP.NET CORE MVC!
